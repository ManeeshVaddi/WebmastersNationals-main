                            Saving Earth is Teamwork and Everyone needs your help as well. The little change in everyday thing you do makes the biggest changes in society as a whole.
                            For example, switching your bulbs to LED is also a way to positively impact the environment as they use 75% less energy than other bulbs like the incandescant ones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything starts out small like a small act of kindness. So, begin your clean energy journey with something small and look at the impact that you might cause.

                            The National Interagency Fire Center has reported that on average, annually there are 70,000 wildfires in around the globe since the 1980s because of global warming.
                            That is annually 86800 acres of forest land burned annually proabably because some people forgot to turn their stoves off.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is where we all come in. On average, we all emit 19 tonnes/2,204 lbs of greenhouses gases per year and this is our opportunity to stop. Simply, by increasing our appliance usage towards green energy.

                            Annual drought rates are out of the chart right now and that too is because of fossil fuels. As of now 10% of contigious United States was experiencing severe drought.
                            One can only feel the amount of tragicness that is involved in the farmers' lives in those regions right now.

                            The average American Household wastes 90 gallons of water per day or 10,000 gallons of water per year. This quickly becomes 1 trillion gallons when we tally the national average...Just for the United States.

                            Over 8 million people die prematurely every year as a result of air pollution – more than twice as many as from malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined. It doesn’t have to be this way. We all need clean air to live, grow and thrive. Yet 99% of us breathe air that is harmful and dirty, making air pollution one of our biggest health threats.

                            Together, we can achieve a better future. Better health. A better standard of living. A better Earth. Unless every single one of us realizes the true potential of our planet and realizes the horrors we have caused it. There will be no change. The Earth has treated us and our age old ancestors well for many years…Now it is our turn. It is our turn to return the favor. By leaving this planet ,we have called home for millions of years, a better place than when we entered.
